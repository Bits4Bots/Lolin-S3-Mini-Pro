Overview of Tetris Game Code
A simple Tetris game involves several key components:

- Game Board: A grid representing the play area.
- Tetrominoes: The falling shapes made of blocks.
- Game Loop: The main loop where the game updates and renders.
- Input Handling: To control the Tetrominoes (move left, right, rotate, drop).
- Collision Detection: To check if Tetrominoes are colliding with the board or other blocks.
- Clearing Lines: To remove filled lines and update the score.
- Game Over Condition: To check if the game is over.

Explanation of Key Sections
Library Imports: The code includes libraries for graphics handling (Adafruit_GFX and Adafruit_ST7735).

Game Board Initialization:

The game board is defined as a 2D array (board) where each cell can hold a value representing whether it's empty or filled.
Tetromino Structure:

Each Tetromino is defined with a 4x4 shape array and its current position (x, y) on the board.
Setup Function:

Initializes the display, clears the board, and generates a new Tetromino.
Game Loop:

Runs continuously, checking if the game is over and moving the current Tetromino down. If it can't move, it places it on the board, checks for filled lines, and spawns a new Tetromino.
Movement & Collision Detection:

The canMove function checks whether the Tetromino can move in the desired direction without colliding with other blocks or going out of bounds.
Placing Tetrominoes:

When a Tetromino reaches the bottom or collides, it is placed on the board, and filled lines are checked and cleared.
Drawing the Board:

The drawBoard function renders the current state of the game board and the Tetrominoes on the display.
Additional Features to Consider
Rotation of Tetrominoes: Implement logic to allow Tetrominoes to rotate.
User Input Handling: Capture button presses to move or rotate Tetrominoes.
Scoring System: Implement a display for the current score and possibly a high score.
Game Over Screen: Display a message or restart option when the game ends.
Conclusion
This Tetris implementation on the S3 Mini Pro ESP32 is a great starting point for understanding game programming concepts such as game loops, collision detection, and rendering graphics. You can expand this code by adding more features and refining the gameplay. If you have specific questions or want to delve deeper into any section, feel free to ask!

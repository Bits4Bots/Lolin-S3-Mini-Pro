Game Concept: Bricks Game
The Bricks Game is a simple yet engaging arcade-style game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break colorful bricks on the screen. The objective is to clear all the bricks by hitting them with the ball while preventing the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen.

Gameplay Overview
Objective:

The primary goal is to break all the colorful bricks by bouncing a ball off a paddle controlled by the player.

The paddle is controlled using two buttons:
Button 0: Move the paddle left.
Button 47: Move the paddle right.
The paddle moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen to intercept the ball.
Button 48: Holding this button for 3 seconds toggles the sound on or off.
Game Elements:

Paddle: A rectangular area at the bottom of the screen that the player controls to bounce the ball.
Ball: A small circle that moves around the screen, bouncing off walls and the paddle.
Bricks: Rectangular blocks positioned in rows above the paddle. Each brick has a vibrant color, making the game visually appealing.
Collision Detection:

The game checks for collisions between the ball and the paddle, ball and walls, and ball and bricks.
When the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears, and the player scores a point. A sound plays if sound is enabled.

All bricks are destroyed, resulting in victory.
The ball falls below the paddle, which leads to a game over.
When the game ends, the screen displays a "Game Over" message and the player's score.
